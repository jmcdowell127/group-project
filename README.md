# group-project Hit Movie Project
## Scope
### To use databases and supervised machine learning predict if a movie will be a hit or not.
Chose this topic because we all enjoy watching movies and prefer movies that are 'hits'.

### Utilized the following items for the â€œhit movie project".
1.	CSV files from Kaggle 
2.	Pandas / Python / Sqlalchemy / Scikit-learn
3.	SQLite to clean and integrate data
4.	Tableau for visualizations and final presentation

### Communication Protocols
* Created a group in Slack with all 4 members to discuss the project.
* Use Zoom when needed to share screen and debug or show the direction we are heading to.
