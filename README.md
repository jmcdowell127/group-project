# Hit Movie Project
## Scope
### To use databases and supervised machine learning to predict if a movie will be a hit or not.
Chose this topic because we all enjoy watching movies and prefer movies that are 'hits'.

### Utilized the following items for this â€œhit movie project".
1.	CSV file from Kaggle - __IMDb movies.csv__
2.	Pandas / Python / Sqlalchemy / Scikit-learn
3.	SQLite to clean and integrate data
4.	Tableau for visualizations and final presentation

### Communication Protocols
* Created a group in Slack with all 4 members to discuss the project.
* Use Zoom when needed to discuss project, share screen and debug code, and also assisting teammates.

### Questions we hope to answer with this analysis
1. Is a movie a hit based on it's metascore?
2. Is a movie a hit based on how much money was grossed?
3. Will a movie be a hit depending on season of the year it was released?
